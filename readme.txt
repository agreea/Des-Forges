====Radar=====
Radar (whose internal name was Des-Forges) is an MVP for a geosocial app that was meant to
create a network for publishing and peer-corroborating citizen journalism content.

Users can capture what's happening around them with the in-app camera, caption the content,
and then post. The application then takes a geotag and timestamp and uploads the content to the server.
Users can vote up or down the content they see.
Currently, the server is down so it isn't very testable any more.

Notes:

Real-time updates for voting still haven't been implemented
